JitterTrap
==========

JitterTrap is a network measurement and impairment tool for developers of real-time applications and devices.

It has two broad areas of use:
* detection and measurement of unexpected delays, introduced by the device or application under test. That is, characterising the source with respect to jitter.
* introducing and controling known network impairment conditions (eg. delay, jitter, packet loss) to verify the correct operation of the device or application under test. That is, characterising the behaviour of destination, with respect to delay, jitter and loss.

How to use it:
----------------
The user interface is implemented as a web application.
